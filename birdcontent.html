            <p>Rheas look like ostriches and are even called South American ostriches. This omnivorous bird type weighs up to 50 pounds, making them the largest South American bird where they are native. </br>
                They are flightless, have long necks and legs, and reach up to 5 feet tall. They eat seeds, fruit, small insects, lizards, and small birds. </p>

            <p>Kiwis are protected in reserves and national parks. They live up to 60 and eat an omnivorous diet of insects, seeds, and berries. Their eggs are enormous in proportion to their body size, which is around 15% of the femaleâ€™s body weight.  </br>
                Kiwis are about the size of chickens, covered in brown feathers, and have thin, elongated beaks. </p>

            <p>Tinamous fall into the Palaeognathae types of birds, but they can fly partially, unlike their ostrich, rhea, and kiwi friends. These birds range from 6 to 20 inches and have a small head and sizeable feathered rump with feather-hidden wings.   </br>
                Tinamouses are ground dwellers who can fly but prefer to run, but they get tired quite quickly, so they are experts in hiding. </p>
