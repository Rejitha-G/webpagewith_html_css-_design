        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adolfo’s catfish (lat. Corydoras adolfoi) is a small-sized, brightly colored, and peaceful aquarium catfish. This fish has quite recently appeared in tanks of aquarium fish fanciers, and it is less popular than other Corydoras species. Adolfo’s Cory is a peaceful species that can be kept with other peaceful fish species of similar size and temperament. They are well-suited for community aquariums, alongside other small, non-aggressive fish like tetras, rasboras, and dwarf cichlids.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Archer fish (lat. Toxotidae) belongs to ray-finned fishes of monotypic family Toxotidae, that in order to feed spray water in the air or on the ground to shoot down insects and then eat them. The droplets hit so hard that insects fall into water, where they are quickly eaten by the fish. It seems that the fish faultlessly knows where its prey falls and goes there fast before other fish gets it or it will be carried away by the water flow. Besides, archer fish similar to silver arowana can jump out of water to catch its prey, though not very high, just at its body length.
